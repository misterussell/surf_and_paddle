# Pixel Perfect Exercise

- This project was an early dive into CSS and creating Pixel Perfect layouts.
- The baseline project requirements were a desktop-first design, with the option to include mobile-friendly options.

## Challenges

- As this was not styled mobile-first it took some time to rethink how different elements on the page needed to be reorganized when tackling the mobile design. I ran into some page flow issues with headers and footers, and had to rethink the order of the floats so that the elements would be in the correct order. I.e., making sure the logo was above the title, or that the mobile menu footer was above the footer logo. 
- There were a few discrepancies with the font sizes compared to the original design, which I handled by concentrating on the height and width of text blocks, rather than the letter spacing and line-height, which were not able to get 100% sync'd up.
